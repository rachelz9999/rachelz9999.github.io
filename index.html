		Hello fellow Bearcats, my name is Rachel Zheng and I am running for ASB Treasurer. 
		We all made this journey here for a reason. Perhaps you came here to listen to awe-inspiring speeches, or perhaps to just simply eat lunch. But I know a small part of each and every one of you cares about this school. You care about the fun events that go on during lunch, about the dances, about the people here. And despite me just being another face, just another candidate, I am here to make those things happen. I am here, running for ASB Treasurer, because I am genuinely and fully dedicated to this position and to this school. Throughout my experience in Junior Council this year, I became truly passionate and interested in all the behind-the-scenes work and efforts of all the events that I used to take for granted. I want to help make them run more smoothly and efficiently so that you can have fun without worries or complaints. Plus as a Site Council rep, my monthly meetings with the principals, teachers, and parents have really opened my eyes to the inner workings of our school and inspired me to be involved in San Mateo at a greater level. And so I'm here, running for ASB Treasurer.
		Most people underestimate the importance of ASB Treasurer, but I do not take this position lightly. As ASB Treasurer, I promise I will use all my ideas, knowledge, and passion to make sure you will have the best experience you can have at this school. Thank you.
		Vote Rachel Zheng for ASB Treasurer! Whoooo<br>
